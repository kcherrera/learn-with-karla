## Creating a simple MVC app with JavaScript

Using JavaScript, we will be creating a todo app that consists of three files: index.html, style.css, script.js and is free of frameworks.
Following Tania Rascia's [guide](https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/).

### Goals

- To build a todo app within browser using vanilla JavaScript
- To get familiar with Model View Controller (MVC) concepts

### What is Model View Controller?

MVC is one popular way to organize your code.

- **Model** - Manages the data of an application
- **View** - A visual representation of the model
- **Controller** - Links the user and the system
